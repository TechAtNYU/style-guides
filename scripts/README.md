### Scripts

Simple scripts to interact with the Tech@NYU API in some way. The best way to use this scripts is to run `ipython` and then run the command `run <script_name>.py`. For example, in `ipython` you could do `run missing_emails.py`, which gives you access to the array `no_email` in the REPL.
